Lead Score Model for X education
X Education, an online education company catering to industry professionals, faces a challenge with low lead conversion rates despite attracting numerous potential customers daily through website visits, form submissions, and referrals. The company seeks to enhance efficiency by identifying 'Hot Leads'â€”leads with higher conversion potential. Currently, only about 30% of acquired leads are converted to paying customers. To address this, X Education aims to develop a lead scoring model that assigns scores to leads based on their likelihood of conversion. This model is intended to aid the sales team in prioritizing communication efforts and focusing on leads that are more likely to convert, potentially raising the overall lead conversion rate to the CEO's target of around 80%.
